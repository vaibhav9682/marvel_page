Welcome to the Super Hero Hunter project! This project provides a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore information about Marvel super heroes. It fetches data from the Marvel API to present details about various heroes, including their names, images, biographies, events, and series. The application is designed to help you learn more about your favorite Marvel characters and keep track of your most beloved heroes.

The Super Hero Hunter project is an API-based web application that leverages the Marvel API to fetch and display information about Marvel super heroes. You can learn about each hero's background, events they participated in, and series they appear in.
